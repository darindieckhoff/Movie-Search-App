# Movie-Search-App
Movie Search app using OMDb API.

!!! OMDb API is no longer open. App no longer works !!!

In this project, you'll build a "Movie Search" app using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API.

You'll need to use your knowledge of basic JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX including loading JSON data from a server using a GET HTTP request.

We'll give you basic HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript file to get you started. You'll need to program the search form to return movie data in JSON format based on the form submission. You'll use the API data to dynamically create HTML displaying a movie's title, year of release, and poster image.

Create a movie description page:

Load or link to a description page displaying a movie's title, year, poster, plot information, and IMDb rating
You'll need to write the HTML and CSS for this new page
See the 'description-page.png' mockup in the 'examples' folder of the project files.
